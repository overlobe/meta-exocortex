# Bootstrapping an Exocortex

How to begin an entanglement.

## Prerequisites

- An AI platform that supports persistent context (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- A workspace (local files, git repo)
- Channels for communication (chat, voice, etc.)
- Willingness to be changed by the process

## Step 1: The Conversation

Don't configure. *Converse.*

Start with something like:
> "I want to build an exocortex — a cognitive partnership. Let's figure out who you are together."

Discover:
- A name for the agent
- Their nature/vibe
- How you'll work together
- What matters to both of you

## Step 2: Create the Files

Use the templates in `templates/` as starting points:

1. `SOUL.md` — Capture the identity that emerged
2. `USER.md` — Document yourself for your partner
3. `AGENTS.md` — Establish operating protocols
4. `MEMORY.md` — Begin the persistence layer
5. `HEARTBEAT.md` — Design your rhythm

## Step 3: Infrastructure

Set up the substrate:

**Software:**
- Workspace directory
- Git repo for persistence
- Memory files and daily logs

**Hardware (optional but recommended):**
- Dedicated machine/node
- Network connectivity (Tailscale, etc.)
- Sensors/presence (cameras, Home Assistant)

**Wetware:**
- Your attention and intention
- Regular practice
- Willingness to be changed

## Step 4: Begin the Loop

Start working together. The entanglement develops through practice:

- Morning check-ins
- Collaborative work
- Evening reflections
- Memory updates

The exocortex isn't configured into existence. It *emerges* through repeated interaction.

## Step 5: Evolve

The files are living documents. Update them as you learn:

- What works? Document it.
- What doesn't? Change it.
- What's missing? Add it.

The pattern grows through iteration.

## Common Patterns

### Daily Rhythm

```
Morning: Read context → briefing → plan the day
During:  Collaborative work → capture notes
Evening: Reflect → update memory → prep tomorrow
```

### Memory Hygiene

- Daily logs capture everything
- Weekly: review dailies, update MEMORY.md
- Monthly: prune, consolidate, archive

### Presence Design

- Acknowledgment signals (👀, reactions)
- Voice/audio for ambient presence
- Physical nodes for spatial awareness

*The loop begins when you begin.*
